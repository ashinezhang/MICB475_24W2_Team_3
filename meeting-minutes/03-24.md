# Mar 24 Meeting Minutes

Experimental Aims: 
1. ~~**Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets~~
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## To do items from last week
* look over aim 2 results, statistical tests? (KT)
* start aim 3 indicator species and core microbiome analysis (AC) 
  * format indicator species output table (DL)
* start aim 4 functional analysis using picrust (AZ + KS)
* brainstorm figures to include in final paper
* start slides

## Meeting Agenda
discuss results and figures - what to include in paper/presentation, how to improve figure readibility, etc. 
* Aim 2 -Added stats for alpha/beta diversity (ns :(), did indicator species
* Aim 3 - finished alpha/beta diversity, core microbiome, indicator species , and DESeq analysis; discuss which plots/comparisons we want to use.
    * stats still need to be done for alpha diversity plots 
* Aim 4 - still in progress
  * [ggpicrust2 was archived from cran last november](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcran.r-project.org%2Fweb%2Fpackages%2Fggpicrust2%2Findex.html&h=AT2Nq3GEsG2HzKg-uUq8QIdhbyiaSnH-oLlHIJ22IsSfJ08DHGynmvRS0FEfyvrplSndor4aPQtc2_vUC3PJjne4E_S9kYeH8Cns_5XCfI9YScPT5mtz4zzqo-51QDrE1WHAeg) so can't install it
    * tried using an older version of R (4.2.2) and its corresponding Rtools (4.2), but also got the same error
    * DL found a way to install from github, which worked
  * lots of troubleshooting that wasn't done in Bilal et al. even though we're using the same dataset
  * data generated saved in the [Aim4 folder](../data/Aim4)

## Meeting Notes
* Aim 1 - Alpha and Beta Diveristy:
 * non-seperation of sex = no significance
 * diabetic group - male and female there is a significant difference

* Aim 3
  * Venn diagram:
    * diabetic male and female, most interesting, showed that diabetic males are more distinct than females.
  * Indicator Species:
     * highest indicator value was .6, most are non-significant. Not a lot of indicator species are present. We ideally want an indicator species value to be .8 or higher. So it seems that these are not the best indicator species.
     * Not suprised as there were not that many unique core microbiome species.
   * DESeq
      * looks like pre-diabetic had the most differences between genders
   
  * PIcrust
     * Change fold change cutoff to +/-2
     * Does look like the biggest difference is still between diabetic female vs male
     * Maybe can look into the pathways that are changed in male vs female
        * Looks like upregulated pathways are in males, as well as increased unique microbes (only 4), why is vanilin pathways upregulated?
        * Quite a bit of degradation pathways
        * Is lower diveristy bad or good for males?
           * potentially seems like a bad thing as there is a upregulation of degradation pathways
     * Possible bias data as there are two males that have upregulated everything pathways

Potential Figures:   
Supplemental 1: 3 panels not stratified - chao1 shannon and faith
* of diabetic and prediabetic and nondiabetic
* not significatn

Fig 1:
* shannon chao1 and PD - but stratified by biological sex 

Fig 2:
* Core microbiome: 3 panels: ABC - stratified by sex (diabetic male vs diabetic female)
* typically we see females more sensitive to disease, but interestingly we found that with males
 * Try going back to see which are unique to the males vs females, to see if they are pathogenic
 * Specifically with diabetic male vs diabetic female; see if there is potentially some pathogenic bactiera doing that
  * See in pre-diabetic too to see if it matches, maybe include non-diabetic too
    
Fig 3:
* indicator - prob nothing - dont include
* Include both DESeq bar and volcane - 6 panels: healthy, pre-diabeic, and diabetic (top to down) with volcano on the side
* Hard to explain

Fig4:
* Just include diabetic pathways (male vs female)
* For the prediabetic and nondiabetic, just mention the pathways int he results as it is just 1 pathway changed

Supplmental 2:
* include heatmap for diabetic male vs female

For paper:
* tell the sotry in the order of the figures

For presentations:
* other group gets 15 minutes with us before the presentation to talk with us about anything.

## To Do
* Make the presentiation slide deck: due next sunday
* Fix the figures up a bit, include stats
* Ideally get figures formatted by next meeting
* Send Ritu slides later this week to look over before submitting

## Important dates
* Presentation slides = March 30
* Oral Presentations = Apr 1 and 3
* Draft Manuscript = Apr 13
* Final Manuscript and Github = Apr ~~22~~25
