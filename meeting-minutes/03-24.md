# Mar 24 Meeting Minutes

Experimental Aims: 
1. ~~**Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets~~
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## To do items from last week
* look over aim 2 results, statistical tests? (KT)
* start aim 3 indicator species and core microbiome analysis (AC) 
  * format indicator species output table (DL)
* start aim 4 functional analysis using picrust (AZ + KS)
* brainstorm figures to include in final paper
* start slides

## Meeting Agenda
discuss results and figures - what to include in paper/presentation, how to improve figure readibility, etc. 
* Aim 2 -
* Aim 3 -
* Aim 4 - unable to do picrust analysis
  * [ggpicrust2 was archived from cran last november](https://l.messenger.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcran.r-project.org%2Fweb%2Fpackages%2Fggpicrust2%2Findex.html&h=AT2Nq3GEsG2HzKg-uUq8QIdhbyiaSnH-oLlHIJ22IsSfJ08DHGynmvRS0FEfyvrplSndor4aPQtc2_vUC3PJjne4E_S9kYeH8Cns_5XCfI9YScPT5mtz4zzqo-51QDrE1WHAeg) so can't install it
  * tried using an older version of R (4.2.2) and its corresponding Rtools (4.2), but also got the same error
