# Feb 10 Meeting Minutes

## To do items from last week
* variable regions sequenced: **still need to figure out paired vs single-end**
    * [Diabetes Texas Dataset Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-015-0072-y#MOESM1): V1 to V3, primers 27f and 534r (I think single-end based on SRA# SRP053023)
    * [Diabetes Mexico Dataset Paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251245): V4, paired-end
    * [Columbia Dataset Paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30054529/): V4, primers F515 and R806 (paired end Acc# PRJNA417579)
* how to merge metadata
    * decide mexico or texas diabetes dataset
        * texas more info
        * mexico has control group
    * columbia - annotate pre-diabetic vs diabetic (same format as texas)
    * make sure columns are same format (e.g. same titles for sex)
    * normalize colombia dataset based on diabetes texas/mexico dataset
        * choosing to control for age, weight/BMI
     
## Meeting Agenda
To Discuss:
* Clearly define research question
* Clarify normalization of the datasets (which parameters are the best to use?; currently thinking of using age and BMI)
     * Some people in the Columbia dataset are taking medication (unspecified); do we need to normalize for this?
     * Concern is that we may lose many samples in the Mexico dataset if we normalize for age (Columbia maxes at ~62 years; many mexico          individuals are above that age)
* Discuss annotation of pre-diabetic status in the Columbia dataset (i.e. group based on fasting glucose levels, then within each group     look at the HA1C)

## Meeting Notes
* if looking at different variable regions, can do rarefaction separately and then combine datasets
   * mexico and columbia both V4 - can combine together before analysis
* manifest file - may need to combine
* server - keep track of who's working on a file
   * back up everything on local

proposal writing
* data wrangling in proposal
   * talk about how to combine datasets
   * mention columns removed
* title - sound like explore
* background info - make it concrete, back it up with evidence
   * cite the papers that don't see difference between healthy/prediabetic, and healthy/diabetic
   * leads into our study of prediabetic vs diabetic
* hypothesis - have something concrete, and back it up
   * could look at non-microbiome studies to see if there are differences
* experiment aims - two questions, one taxonomic, one functional, taxonomic first
* metrics - mention statistical test to determine significance
   * be specific on which test 

diabetic categories:
* determining pre-diabetic
   * Bilal et al. looked at fasting glucose level and HbA1C separately
   * could be better to combine and look at both
   * sample size - Bilal et al. found 21 were pre-diabetic based on fasting glucose levels, but Mexico dataset has 14 diabetic
   * fasting glucose = fast for 8 hrs
   * HbA1C = average glucose levels for past 2-3 months
   * looking at both - potentially losing the more milder pre-diabetic individuals
      * could do have either HbA1C or fasting glucose - include wider range
* could also do diabetic, pre-diabetic, potentially pre-diabetic, healthy

functional vs taxonomic
* module 19 - functional analysis using picrust2
* no major differences found in taxonomic by other papers, so maybe something different in functional
* add to the proposal, keep options open

normalization
* age - mexico age ranges older than columbian
   * majority around 60s, maybe remove the older outliers (e.g. 87 year old)
   * columbia oldest 62
   * type 2 diabetes - develops over time, makes sense that they're older
* BMI
   * can also check if lean/overweight/obese aligns with BMI values
   * mexico dataset has lean/overweight/obese/severe - can modify either columbia to add severe or change severes to obese
   * can create own ranges for both? can base on [CDC ranges](https://www.cdc.gov/bmi/adult-calculator/bmi-categories.html)

to do
* assign parts of proposal
* start on the combining of datasets
* decide if/when we want to meet next week 

#### next week = reading week, meeting optional, can also be over zoom
#### proposal due Feb 23rd!
