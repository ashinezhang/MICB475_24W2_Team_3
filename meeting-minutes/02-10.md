# Feb 10 Meeting Minutes

## To do items from last week
* variable regions sequenced: **still need to figure out paired vs single-end**
    * [Diabetes Texas Dataset Paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-015-0072-y#MOESM1): V1 to V3, primers 27f and 534r (I think single-end based on SRA# SRP053023)
    * [Diabetes Mexico Dataset Paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0251245): V4, paired-end
    * [Columbia Dataset Paper](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30054529/): V4, primers F515 and R806 (paired end Acc# PRJNA417579)
* how to merge metadata
    * decide mexico or texas diabetes dataset
        * texas more info
        * mexico has control group
    * columbia - annotate pre-diabetic vs diabetic (same format as texas)
    * make sure columns are same format (e.g. same titles for sex)
    * normalize colombia dataset based on diabetes texas/mexico dataset
        * choosing to control for age, weight/BMI
     
## Meeting Agenda
To Discuss:
* Clearly define research question
* Clarify normalization of the datasets (which parameters are the best to use?; currently thinking of using age and BMI)
     * Some people in the Columbia dataset are taking medication (unspecified); do we need to normalize for this?
     * Concern is that we may lose many samples in the Mexico dataset if we normalize for age (Columbia maxes at ~62 years; many mexico          individuals are above that age)
* Discuss annotation of pre-diabetic status in the Columbia dataset (i.e. group based on fasting glucose levels, then within each group     look at the HA1C)
