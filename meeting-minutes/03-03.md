# Mar 03 Meeting Minutes

Experimental Aims: 
1. **Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## To do items from last week
* don't need to find primers because both are V4 region
  * can combine datasets and use the Colombian primers to train classifier
* clean up and merge datasets - uploaded into data and scripts folders 
* start qiime processing 

## Meeting Agenda
* if needed: review how to use Github to make sure everyone can access the Rproj and pull/commit/push
  * in terminal, run ```git clone https://github.com/ashinezhang/MICB475_24W2_Team_3.git```
* go over proposal feedback, some points to discuss: 
  * need to add more background information to the intro
  * should we include the Metformin condition?
  * why did we choose Shannon's for alpha diversity?
  * what analysis are we doing for 1F (geographic and demographic factors)
  * what does beta diversity tell us? use PCoA plot to visualize beta diversity
* review combined metadata to see if anything looks wrong or is missing
  * clean up Github since we have multiple scripts and files
* discuss qiime processing 
  * importing using manifest files
    * mexico dataset - did not work with the code in the modules because its paired end, so a different code was found and used
    * should the colombia dataset also be switched to the paired end code? both datasets are paired end, but previous UJEMI paper [Bilal et al.](https://github.com/loujainbilal/MICB475_Team4/blob/main/QIIME2/Data%20processing%20using%20the%20QIIME%202%20pipeline/Merged.txt) used the single end code for the Colombia dataset
    * also, for both single and paired end, there's Phred33V2 and Phred64V2, don't fully understand the difference
      * it assumes the PHRED offset used for positional quality scores is either 33 or 64, so for 64 it converts it to 33
      * how do we check positional quality scores?

## Meeting Notes
Merging datasets
* two sample IDs in Mexico dataset, took the column that matches with the manifest file
* append manifest files
* single vs paired end
  * mexico manifest has forward and reverse
  * colombia manifest only has absolute
  * seems like colombia is single end - do processing separately

Proposal Feedback
* title - "Sex-Specific" might be too much emphasis on sex
* explain what Metformin is first
  * mention it as a limitation
  * hypothesize either we see that diabetics are less diverse than prediabetic, or Metformin treatment we see diabetics more diverse and more similar to non-diabetic
* better to mention more than less - stay on the safer side
* experimental aims
  * aim 1 - elaborate why are we merging it, what are next steps
    * can mention that we are merging later cause its single end and paired end
    * why are we merging - one doesnt have prediabetic
* approach table - be more specific for analyses being used
* make it more explicit that we want to compare pre-diabetic to diabetic
* last paragraph for each aim - write how answering that question contributes to RQ, make it more explicit
* find citations for packages (e.g. QIIME2, PICRUSt2) and metrics (Shannon, etc.) - original paper that made it
  * sources listed on the assignment page
* justify which metric to use - add to aims section
* change paired to single for colombia in the table
* BMI - keep that sentence and the values together
  * mention that it is included as a control, in case we see any weird results
  * could remove the BMI portion, since we are proposing the project, so could just include it in the final manuscript discussion
* data wrangling section - mention how they categorized
  * mexico = clinical diagnosis
  * justify our method for diagnosis (fasting flucose OR HbA1C)

## To do
* edit and resubmit proposal with revisions by **March 10**
* continue with qiime processing
  * [denoising](https://docs.qiime2.org/jupyterbooks/cancer-microbiome-intervention-tutorial/020-tutorial-upstream/040-denoising.html) needs to be paired for mexico, unless we just discard the reverse reads
