# Mar 03 Meeting Minutes

Experimental Aims: 
1. **Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## To do items from last week
* don't need to find primers because both are V4 region
  * can combine datasets and use the Colombian primers to train classifier
* clean up and merge datasets - uploaded into data and scripts folders 
* start qiime processing 

## Meeting Agenda
* if needed: review how to use Github to make sure everyone can access the Rproj and pull/commit/push
  * in terminal, run ```git clone https://github.com/ashinezhang/MICB475_24W2_Team_3.git```
* review combined metadata to see if anything looks wrong or is missing
  * clean up Github since we have multiple scripts and files
* discuss qiime processing *(likely working on it over the weekend, will update meeting agenda by monday)*
  * importing using manifest files
    * mexico dataset - did not work with the code in the modules because its paired end, so a different code was found and used
    * should the colombia dataset also be switched to the paired end code? both datasets are paired end, but previous UJEMI paper [Bilal et al.](https://github.com/loujainbilal/MICB475_Team4/blob/main/QIIME2/Data%20processing%20using%20the%20QIIME%202%20pipeline/Merged.txt) used the single end code for the Colombia dataset
    * also, for both single and paired end, there's Phred33V2 and Phred64V2, don't fully understand the difference
      * it assumes the PHRED offset used for positional quality scores is either 33 or 64, so for 64 it converts it to 33
      * how do we check positional quality scores?
