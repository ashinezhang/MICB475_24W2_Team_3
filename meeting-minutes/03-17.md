# Mar 17 Meeting Minutes

Experimental Aims: 
1. ~~**Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets~~
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## To do items from last week
* remade metadata and qiime2 analysis for colombia dataset
* generated alpha and beta diversity on qiime
* phyloseq object made
* currently working on aims

## Meeting Agenda
* Discuss qiime2 alpha and beta diversity analysis
* Aim 2- reference category, taxa heat map

## Meeting Notes
* qiime2 diversity analysis:
  * did not have significant differences between groups
  * beta diversity pairwise permanova
    * non-diabetic male and female have significant differences, but significant differences disappear with diabetes
* aim 2 plots:
  * still need to do statistical tests
  * no significant groups in PCoA, axes also lower than normal
  * log bar plot = deseq prediabetic and diabetic with diabetic as references
* aim 3: analysis = core microbiome, indicator species, deseq
* aim 4: analysis = picrust, also has deseq component

## To Do
* start aim 3 indicator species and core microbiome analysis (AC) 
  * use "diabetic_status_and_sex" column for these analyses
* brainstorm figures to include in final paper
* start slides

## Important dates
* Presentation slides = March 30
* Oral Presentations = Apr 1 and 3
* Draft Manuscript = Apr 13
* Final Manuscript and Github = Apr 22
