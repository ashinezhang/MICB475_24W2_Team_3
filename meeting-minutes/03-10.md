# Mar 10 Meeting Minutes

Experimental Aims: 
1. **Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## To do items from last week
* qiime processing - in progress
* resubmiting proposal with revisions tonight!

## Meeting Agenda
* go over edited proposal
* discuss qiime processing
  * completed denoising on screens
  * double check that we don't need to train classifier?
  * taxabarplot - regional differences observed
    * more purple (Bacteroides) in Mexico samples
