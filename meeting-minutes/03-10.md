# Mar 10 Meeting Minutes

Experimental Aims: 
1. **Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## To do items from last week
* qiime processing - complete
* resubmiting proposal with revisions tonight!

## Meeting Agenda
* go over edited proposal
* discuss qiime processing
  * completed denoising on screens
  * double check that we don't need to train classifier
    * mpt and mouse tutorials were V4, so can use same classifier
  * taxabarplot - regional differences observed
    * more purple (Bacteroides) in Mexico samples
  * rarefaction was completed - need to decide on sampling depth (6500?)
 * How do we assess alpha and beta diversity
   * do we need to filter the data into each category first?

## Meeting Notes
* regional differences
  * put in the main paper - finding that we were expecting but not part of research question
  * categorize as colombia_healthy etc.
  * ex. all pre-diabetic from colombia, so diff between pre-diabetic vs diabetic, it's not cause of diabetic status, it's regional - what to do?
  * could it be experimental differences? is it for sure regional
* analysis that we can do
  * indicator species - find differences between pre-diabetic vs diabetic
    * if it's ex. bacteroides could be regional, others diabetic status?
    * based on relative abundance
  * core-microbiome - can set thresholds
    * can kinda say which species are there irrespective of region
  * compare healthy mexico to healthy colombia to identify overlapping species
    * similarly, compare diabetic to diabetic from both datasets, and pre-diabetic to pre-diabetic from both datasets
    * when comparing diabetic to pre-diabetic, only look at the overlapping species identified previously
      * non overlapping species would likely be regional differences
    * would also have to do the same thing for male vs female
* could just do colombia dataset...
  * we are just doing colombia
  * still novel compared to Bilal et al. UJEMI paper
    * classifing as diabetic, prediabetic, and nondiabetic
    * looking at sex differences
* emphasize sex differences? since it's more novel

## To do
* focus just on colombia dataset 
  * don't need to change proposal to match new plan
* make new metadata file
  * separate into diabetic and diabetic_sex (2 columns to make it easier to analyse the different aims)
* compare alpha and beta diversity
  * alpha = within group; beta = between two groups
* statistical test to see if differences are significant

## Important dates
* Oral Presentations = Apr 1 and 3, but need to submit slides before then for another group to present
  * aim to be done
* Draft Manuscript = Apr 13; Final Manuscript and Github = Apr 22
