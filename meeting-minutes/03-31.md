# Mar 31 Meeting Minutes

Experimental Aims: 
1. ~~**Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets~~
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## To do items from last week
* Make the presentiation slide deck
* Fix figures

## Meeting Agenda
* discuss manuscript and assign sections

## Meeting Notes
* new result: indicator species - 2 above 0.7 for everyone except diabetic males
  * beneficial bacteria, aligns with story
  * table 2 in main paper, but mention in core microbiome written section
  * very small table but it's ok
* methods - sample sizes as table 1
* manuscript - figures put at the end of the doc, supplemental in a separate doc
* can email figures to get feedback from TA
* UJEMI submission
  * will pick if we want to do UJEMI or UJEMI+
  * do a final proof to make sure formatting works
  * UJEMI+ will pair with reviewers (usually people who generated dataset)
    * editors give feedback, revise
    * never in our course been rejected by reviewers (so far)
    * end of july/aug
    * won't have additional analyses - can write as limitations/future directions, don't need to rerun
    * might need to fix figures up
