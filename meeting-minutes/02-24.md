# Feb 24 Meeting Minutes

## Meeting Agenda
* proposal complete!
  * discuss aim 1: how to account for regional differences
  * any big flaws in our plan?
* data wrangling
  * review annotated metadata
  * discuss proposed method of combining datasets
  * is it ok to not normalize dataset?
    * will make sure BMI ranges are comparable if we need to normalize in the future
  * manifest file? 
* do we need to train classifier?

## Experimental Aims: 
Aim 1: Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets
Aim 2: Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
Aim 3: Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
Aim 4: Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with diabetic status

## Meeting Notes
* manifest file doesn't need editing unless we remove samples
  * need to be careful matching and removing samples
  * can also remove in the R stage
* get started on qiime part
  * might have software issues, download everything locally at every stage
* regional differences:
