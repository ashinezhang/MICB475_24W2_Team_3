# Feb 24 Meeting Minutes

## Meeting Agenda
* proposal complete!
  * discuss aim 1: how to account for regional differences
  * any big flaws in our plan?
* data wrangling
  * review annotated metadata
  * discuss proposed method of combining datasets
  * is it ok to not normalize dataset?
    * will make sure BMI ranges are comparable if we need to normalize in the future
  * manifest file? 
* do we need to train classifier?

## Experimental Aims: 
1. **Aim 1:** Define the baseline taxonomic differences in our combined dataset arising from regional differences in the Mexico and Colombia datasets
2. **Aim 2:** Determine whether taxonomic variations are present between the gut microbiomes of pre-diabetic and diabetic individuals
3. **Aim 3:** Identify potential sex-related differences in gut microbiome composition between pre-diabetic or diabetic males and females
4. **Aim 4:** Explore the functional changes in the gut microbiome associated with sex and diabetic status

## Meeting Notes

* get started on qiime part
  * might have software issues, download everything locally at every stage
* regional differences:
  * non-diabetic in each region to get baseline
  * start with taxa bar plot - see if there are differences
    * just non-diabetic
  * maybe indicator species
  * not the main question, addressing other aims more important, don't spend too long
  * if there are differences, just address it in the paper, maybe put in supplemental
    * e.g. since diabetic mostly from Mexican dataset, and prediabetic in Colombian dataset, if species A dominant in Mexican dataset compared to Colombian, and also in diabetic vs prediabetic, could be regional difference rather than diabetic vs prediabetic difference
* data wrangling/merging
  * manifest file doesn't need editing unless we remove samples
    * need to be careful matching and removing samples
    * can also remove in the R stage
  * sample IDs are different, so it should be ok
* normalizing datasets
  * e.g. age, BMI
    * Mexican dataset - older, Colombian dataset - younger - can't normalize
    * classify BMI in the same way
  * not looking for those differences, so it should be ok
  * can add to discussion part of paper
* probably need to train classifier
  * code is in module 6
  * need to find primer sequences

## To do:
* primer sequences - Colombian dataset has it, Mexican dataset not written in paper, need to find it
  * [Mexican dataset sequence read archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA719138)
  * check sequence after index
  * try ctrl-F for common primer sequences (doesn't match with Colombian's primers)
  * ask for help
  * maybe email authors?
  * last resort - only use Colombian dataset
* qiime part - clean up Mexican dataset, start qiime processing
* can't merge yet since don't have Mexican dataset primers
  * if want to combine later, need to have the same sampling depth
