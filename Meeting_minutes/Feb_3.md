# Feb 3 Meeting Minutes

## Agenda ##

### 1. Discuss possible project topics: ###
Diabetes dataset compared with columbian dataset
* diabetes paper says no significant microbiome shifts associated with any measures, and suggests that the shift in microbiome may occur earlier in diabetes onset
   * group that found dataset pivoted to columbian dataset to study pre-diabetic individuals
   * try to combine them?
* can use fasting glucose levels to determine if someone is pre-diabetic/diabetic
* compare microbiome differences between pre-diabetic and diabetic
* can also incorporate sex differences since women with diabetes often have worse outcomes
